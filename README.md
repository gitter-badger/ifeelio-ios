iFeelio app for iOS

**this app is not currently functional**

I am uploading the latest version of the iFeelio app code that I have for iOS. It currently does not appear on the App Store
because I believe it is 32-bit and the App Store now requires 64-bit. I built the Android version and had someone else develop
the iOS version.
